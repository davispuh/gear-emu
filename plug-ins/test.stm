! Below is some examples of valid stimuli
!
! Time indications are in seconds, use 
! ------------------------------------
!   n - for nano
!   u - for micro
!   m - for milli
!   K - for Kilo
!   M - for Mega
! Time may be given in a relative format by starting the line with a +
! but once you've done that, mixing absolute times could result in events 
! that never occur. Times may be floating point eg. 1.237m is valid, and is
! the same as 1237u
!
! Pin states are:
! ---------------
!   0 - Low = zero
!   1 - High = one
!   x - No longer driven
!
! The format for the clock command is:
! ------------------------------------
! clock=[pin], but this will NOT start the clock. 
! One or more of the following words are required:
! high=[time]  or  low=[time]  or  period=[time]  or  pwm=[0.001 to 0.999]
!   * the first one used determines the initial state of the clock
!   * only absolute times are allowed (NO +)
!   * If only one is given, then the clock is symmetrical
!
! The format for the serial port transmitter is:
! ----------------------------------------------
! Well have a look at the example, but it is NOT YET IMPLEMENTED


! Start some clocks on pins to and 3
! Clock 2 will start high then go low, clock 3 will start low then go high
500u clock=2 high=20u low=15u clock=3 low=10u high=20u

! 10 microseconds later send a message on pin 4
! NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
+10u tx=4 baud=115.2K bytes="G'Day",32,'"World"',13,$A,0 stop=1 mode=01
! 10 microseconds later send a message on pin 5, with different pin drives
! NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
+10u tx=5 baud=115.2K bytes="G'Day",32,'"World"',13,$A,0 stop=1 mode=0x

! Do some pin jiggling
+100u 10=001 17=1
+10u 10=010
+10u 10=100
+10u 10=001

+10u 12=x
+50u 11=1
+50u 10=xxx 17=x stop
+50u 3=x

! Start a clock on pin 2 to demostrate a varying amount of PWM.
+20u clock=2 period=20u pwm=0.05
+20u clock=2 pwm=0.1
+20u clock=2 pwm=0.2

+20u clock=2 pwm=0.7
+20u clock=2 pwm=0.8
+20u clock=2 pwm=0.9
+20u 2=x stop

! Put the pwm at 70%, and then vary the frequency
+20u clock=3 period=20u pwm=0.2
